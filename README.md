# VBA-Save-Cleaner

If you have multiple save files for a .gba rom in a folder, this script will delete them all except for the one that was most recently modified, which will presumably be the save you're playing with. Specifically comes in handy after VBA's link function. Place the exe file in the same folder as your roms and double click it to run.
